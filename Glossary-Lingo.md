# Master the Lingo , Ultimate Guide to Audiophile Lingo
A beginner-friendly dictionary of words used in mixing, mastering, and audio production.
---
## A

*Aliasing*
Distortion caused when a signal exceeds half the sampling rate.

*Amplitude*
The strength or intensity of an audio signal, perceived as loudness.

*Attack*
How quickly a compressor or envelope reacts when sound begins.



## B

*Balance*
The relative volume levels of tracks in a mix.

*Bandwidth*
The range of frequencies affected by an EQ band.

*Bit Depth*
Number of bits used per sample. More bit depth = more dynamic range.

*Boomy*
A muddy, overpowering low-frequency build-up (usually 120–250 Hz).

---

## C

*Clipping*
Distortion caused when the signal exceeds max level in analog or digital.

*Compression*
Reducing the dynamic range of audio by controlling loud peaks.

*Crossover*
Frequency point at which a signal is split between drivers (sub, woofer, tweeter).

*Crisp*
Bright, clear high-frequency detail without harshness.

---

## D

*Damping*
The absorption of sound reflections in a room.

*Decay*
The time it takes for a sound to fade out after the source ends.

*De-essing*
Reducing harsh “S” or “T” sounds in vocals.

*Dry*
Audio without effects like reverb or delay.

---

## E

*EQ (Equalization)*
Cutting or boosting specific frequency ranges.

*Early Reflections*
Initial reflections in a reverb that give spatial cues.

*Envelope*
Shape of a sound over time (attack, decay, sustain, release).

---

## F

*Frequency*
Pitch of a sound, measured in Hertz (Hz).

*Flutter Echo*
Rapid, ringing reflection between two parallel surfaces.

*Fundamental*
The primary pitch of a sound, with overtones above it.

---

## G

*Gain Staging*
Managing proper signal levels at every stage in the chain.

*Gate*
Mutes or reduces signals below a threshold—used for noise control.

---

## H

*Harmonics*
Overtones above the fundamental frequency.

*Headroom*
Safe level margin before clipping.

*Harsh*
Shrill high-frequency buildup (usually 3k–8k).

---

## I

*Imaging*
The perceived placement of sounds in the stereo field.

*Impulse Response (IR)*
A capture of a space or hardware’s sonic characteristics.

---

## J

*Jitter*
Timing errors in digital audio, causing distortion.

---

## K

*Knee*
Describes how gradually or sharply a compressor engages.

---

## L

*Latency*
Delay between input and output in a system.

*Localization*
Ability to detect where a sound is coming from.

*Lush*
Rich, thick ambience or reverb.

---

## M

*Masking*
When one sound hides another due to overlapping frequencies.

*Muddy*
Too much low-mid energy (200–500 Hz), reducing clarity.

*Mono*
Single-channel audio.

*Multiband Compression*
Compression applied to independent frequency ranges.

---

## N

*Noise Floor*
The baseline level of noise in a system.

*Notch Filter*
EQ cut at a narrow frequency to remove resonances.

---

## O

*Overtones*
Higher frequencies above the fundamental that shape timbre.

*Oversampling*
Processing at higher sample rates to reduce aliasing.

---

## P

*Pan*
Placement of a sound between left and right speakers.

*Phase*
Relationship between two waveforms; poor phase causes thinning or cancellation.

*Punchy*
Strong, tight low-end transient impact.

---

- Q

*Q Factor*
Controls the width of an EQ band.

---

## R

*Release*
How fast a compressor stops reducing gain after the signal falls.

*Resonance*
A peak at a specific frequency due to natural vibration.

*Rumble*
Very low-frequency noise (below 80 Hz).

---

## S

*Saturation*
Pleasant harmonic distortion from analog-style processing.

*Sibilance*
Harsh “S,” “Sh,” or “T” sounds in vocals.

*Sibilant Range*
5–10 kHz area where sibilance occurs.

*Sustain*
Middle part of a sound envelope after decay.

---

## T

*Timbre*
Character or color of a sound.

*Transient*
The initial, punchy attack of a sound.

*Tinny*
Weak low-end, overly bright mids/highs.

---

## U

*Unison*
Multiple voices playing the same pitch, often thickening synths.

---

## V

*Vintage*
Warm, colored sound reminiscent of older analog gear.

*Vocal Fry*
Low-register creaking sound in speech or singing.

---

## W

*Warmth*
Pleasant fullness in low-mids (150–400 Hz) with smooth highs.

*Wide*
Broad stereo image with separation between left and right.

---

## X

*XLR*
Balanced three-pin audio connector used for mics and pro equipment.

---

## Y

*Y-Cable*
Cable that splits one signal into two or combines two into one.

---

## Z

*Zero Crossing*
Point where a waveform crosses zero amplitude—important for click-free edits.
