## Basic Audio Concepts

### Sound Waves and Frequency

Sound is a pressure wave. Its pitch is determined by frequency (cycles per second, Hz), and its loudness by amplitude. Humans hear roughly 20 Hz–20 kHz ￼. For example, deep bass is near 20–60 Hz, vocals and guitars occupy midrange, and cymbals and sibilance are in the upper range. Modern audio workstations and speakers are designed around this range ￼ (see diagram below).
