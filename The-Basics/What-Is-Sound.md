# What is Sound ?

Sound is a mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a medium, such as a solid, liquid, or gas. In simpler terms, it is a vibration that travels through a medium and can be heard when it reaches a person's or animal's ear.

## Physics of Sound

In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum. The vibrations are generated by a sound source, such as a vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker, which creates vibrations in the surrounding medium. As the source continues to vibrate the medium, the vibrations propagate away from the source at the speed of sound, thus forming the sound wave.

### Waves

Sound is transmitted through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. Through solids, however, it can be transmitted as both longitudinal waves and transverse waves.

*   **Longitudinal waves** are waves of alternating pressure deviations from the equilibrium pressure, causing local regions of compression and rarefaction.
*   **Transverse waves**, also known as shear waves, are waves of alternating shear stress at a right angle to the direction of propagation.

### Properties of Sound Waves

Sound waves are characterized by the generic properties of waves, which are:

*   **Frequency:** The number of complete wave cycles that pass a given point in a certain amount of time. In music, we perceive frequency as pitch.
*   **Amplitude:** The measure of a sound wave's intensity, which we perceive as volume or loudness.
*   **Wavelength:** The distance from one peak of a wave to the next.
*   **Speed of Sound:** The speed at which sound waves travel through a medium. This depends on the properties of the medium, such as its temperature and density. For example, sound travels faster in water than in air.

## Perception of Sound

In physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain. The field of psychoacoustics is dedicated to such studies.

### Human Hearing

For humans, hearing is limited to a range of frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz), with the upper limit generally decreasing with age. Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound, and those below 20 Hz are known as infrasound. Other species have different ranges of hearing. For example, dogs can perceive vibrations higher than 20 kHz.

### Pitch, Loudness, and Timbre

*   **Pitch** is the perception of how "high" or "low" a sound is and is primarily determined by frequency.
*   **Loudness** is the perception of the intensity of a sound and is related to the amplitude of the sound wave.
*   **Timbre** is the quality of a sound that distinguishes different types of sound production, such as voices and musical instruments.

## Applications of Sound

Humans have developed culture and technology that allows them to generate, record, transmit, and broadcast sound. Some of the key applications include:

*   **Communication:** Many species use sound for communication, and in humans, this has evolved into speech and language.
*   **Music:** The art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.
*   **Technology:** Sound is used in a wide range of technologies, including sonar for navigation and detection, ultrasound for medical imaging, and audio engineering for recording and reproducing sound.
